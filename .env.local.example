# OpenAI API Configuration
# To enable real OpenAI API calls instead of mock responses:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Add your OpenAI API key below
# 3. Restart the development server

NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Note: NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes this available to the browser
# Only use this for development or when you trust the deployment environment
# For production, consider using server-side API routes with secure key storage
